# npm Boilerplate

This repository serves as my re-usable boilerplate for whenever I roll a new npm package or project, as I usually forget one or two of the following files, and find myself always copying these from other projects:

- `readme.md`
- `package.json`
- `license`
- `.travis.yml`
- `.jshintrc`
- `.gitignore`

Feel free to share, fork, clone -- whatever! üçª
